There are several ways to transfer the value of the rsp register to the rsi register, even if the gadgets you have available do not include the mov instruction. Some options you could try include:  

Pop the value into a register and then move it to rsi. For example, you can use the pop rsi instruction to pop the top value off the stack into the rsi register, or use pop rax followed by mov rsi, rax to move the value from rax to rsi.  

Use a gadget that includes a lea instruction to load the value of rsp into a register. The lea (Load Effective Address) instruction can be used to compute the address of a memory location and store it in a register. For example, you can use the gadget lea rax, [rsp+0x8] to load the value at rsp+0x8 into the rax register, and then use mov rsi, rax to move the value from rax to rsi.  

Use a gadget that includes a call instruction to call a function that returns the value of rsp. The call instruction pushes the address of the next instruction onto the stack and jumps to the specified function. You can then use a function that returns the value of rsp by pushing it onto the stack and returning. For example, you can use the gadget call rax to call a function in rax, and then use a function like this:  
`
push rsp; ret
`

This function pushes the value of rsp onto the stack and then returns, leaving the value of rsp on the top of the stack. You can then use a gadget like pop rsi to pop the value off the stack into the rsi register.
