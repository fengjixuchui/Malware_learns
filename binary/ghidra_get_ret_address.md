To find the return address using Ghidra:

Open the binary in Ghidra and navigate to the function that you want to analyze.

Click on the "Decompile" tab to view the decompiled code for the function.

Scroll down to the end of the function and look for the "ret" instruction. This is the instruction that will return control to the caller after the function has finished executing.

To find the location of the return address in the stack, you can look for the instruction that pushes the return address onto the stack before the function is called. This is typically a "push" instruction that pushes a register or a memory location onto the stack. The return address will be stored at the top of the stack, so you can determine the offset of the return address from the base of the stack by counting the number of "push" instructions before it.

You can also use the Ghidra debugger to analyze the stack and find the return address. To do this, set a breakpoint at the "ret" instruction and run the debugger. When the breakpoint is hit, you can examine the stack and find the value of the return address by looking at the top of the stack.
