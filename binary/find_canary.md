To manually determine the address of the stack canary with gdb, we can use the following steps:  
  
Start the binary in gdb and set a breakpoint at the entry point of the program (usually the main function).  
```
$ gdb paycalc
(gdb) b main
``` 
Run the program until the breakpoint is reached and then print the value of the __stack_chk_guard symbol, which is usually the address of the stack canary.  
```
(gdb) r
(gdb) p __stack_chk_guard
$1 = 0x7ffd53b907e0
```
Alternatively, we can use the info registers command to print the values of all registers, including the stack pointer (rsp) and the base pointer (rbp), which can be used to calculate the offset of the stack canary.  
```
(gdb) info registers

rsp            0x7ffd53b907e0   0x7ffd53b907e0
rbp            0x7ffd53b907e8   0x7ffd53b907e8
```
In this example, the stack pointer is pointing to the address of the stack canary, which means that the offset of the stack canary is 0. If the base pointer is pointing to the address of the stack canary, the offset is 8, and so on.  

Once we have the address of the stack canary, we can use the x/g command to print the value of the canary itself.  
```
(gdb) x/g 0x7ffd53b907e0
0x7ffd53b907e0: 0x6745230167452301
```
In this example, the stack canary value is 0x6745230167452301. Note that the value and the address of the stack canary may vary depending on the specific binary and its protections.  

## No symbols  
If the binary hs no symbols, we can use gef:  
```
gefâž¤  canary
