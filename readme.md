### This repo wil be a dumping ground of stuff I have learnt/am learning

Trying to focus on AV evasion, payloads have been covered in [SLAE](https://kymb0.github.io/slae-3/)  

Have completed https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=3

Have completed https://institute.sektor7.net/view/courses/red-team-operator-malware-development-essentials/  
Have completed https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=37  

~~Will need to do x64 SLAE at some point: https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=7~~  

~~Time to do OSEP~~, after that likely CRTO, definitely advanced malware by sektor7, then cybernetics/APT prolab
